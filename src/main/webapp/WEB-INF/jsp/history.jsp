            <p>In 2006, Bike Rental Management System founder <a href="#employees-keagangonsalves">Keagan Gonsalves</a> set out to create a system that would be <em>environmentally friendly</em> and backed by scientific and <em>performance data</em> ? to provide a strong basis of <em>trust and accountability</em>.</p>
            <p>His quest began while working for his <em>first technical support role</em>, after graduating from <em>University of Hertfordshire</em> that left him with some knowledge and expertise required to develop his vision of developing a bike rental system which supports the environment and supports recycling. He yearned for <em>simple and natural ingredients</em>, in their purest form, instead of labels with <em>lengthy chemical names</em> and disclaimers. When no products lived up to his strict requirements, Henry set his sights on <em>creating products</em> that catered to his own vision.
            </p>
            <p>Today that vision has become Bike Rental Management System?offering a variety of 
                <a href="#products">bicycle, bike and e-bikes</a>. At the foundation of Bike Rental Management 
                System are products backed by scientific and performance data.
